# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Site purpose

The design of the site is to promote the local trivia night that I host called Quiz Ninjas.

## Components and pages

The site uses components: Title, Footer, Menu, and three different page components.
Each page identifier is easily updated, and each can be used as a template with simple text replacement.

## Testing:

Each page and component was rendered and a simple text-match test was performed to make sure each component was rendered correctly.
